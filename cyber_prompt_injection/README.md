#  Prompt Injection in AI Systems

This repository contains notes and resources about **Prompt Injection attacks** in AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).


##  What is Prompt Injection?

**Prompt Injection** happens when an attacker manipulates the input given to an AI model (like ChatGPT) to make it:
